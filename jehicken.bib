title="Homotopy curve tracking in approximate interior point optimization",
journal="Optimization and Engineering",
year="2009",
volume="10",
number="1",
pages="91--108",
abstract="In a previous work the authors developed an interior point approach for trust region managed sequential approximate optimization. The interior point approach insures that approximate feasibility is maintained throughout the optimization process. In the case of an infeasible starting point, a relaxation of the constraints allows the algorithm to operate without modification. The relaxation is controlled by a homotopy parameter. A primary advantage resides in the fact that all the constraints (contrasted with just the active or most violated constraints) influence the optimization, since the relaxation fades at the same time for all violated constraints. Adjustment of the parameter was performed in an heuristic fashion. In this paper the authors present a robust methodology to update the homotopy parameter based on the theory of probability-one homotopies for nonlinear programming. Results show that the method is robust and effective in its implementation for achieving sequential approximate optimization feasibility.",

pages="457--480",
abstract="In this paper we present a redesign of a linear algebra kernel of an interior point method to avoid the explicit use of problem matrices. The only access to the original problem data needed are the matrix-vector multiplications with the Hessian and Jacobian matrices. Such a redesign requires the use of suitably preconditioned iterative methods and imposes restrictions on the way the preconditioner is computed. A two-step approach is used to design a preconditioner. First, the Newton equation system is regularized to guarantee better numerical properties and then it is preconditioned. The preconditioner is implicit, that is, its computation requires only matrix-vector multiplications with the original problem data. The method is therefore well-suited to problems in which matrices are not explicitly available and/or are too large to be stored in computer memory. Numerical properties of the approach are studied including the analysis of the conditioning of the regularized system and that of the preconditioned regularized system. The method has been implemented and preliminary computational results for small problems limited to 1 million of variables and 10 million of nonzero elements demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.",

abstract="We present a matrix-free line search algorithm for large-scale equality constrained optimization that allows for inexact step computations. For strictly convex problems, the method reduces to the inexact sequential quadratic programming approach proposed by Byrd et al. [SIAM J. Optim. 19(1) 351--369, 2008]. For nonconvex problems, the methodology developed in this paper allows for the presence of negative curvature without requiring information about the inertia of the primal--dual iteration matrix. Negative curvature may arise from second-order information of the problem functions, but in fact exact second derivatives are not required in the approach. The complete algorithm is characterized by its emphasis on sufficient reductions in a model of an exact penalty function. We analyze the global behavior of the algorithm and present numerical results on a collection of test problems.",

    abstract = {{In its basic form, the reverse mode of computational differentiation yields the gradient of a scalar-valued function at a cost that is a small multiple of the computational work needed to evaluate the function itself. However, the corresponding memory requirement is proportional to the run-time of the evaluation program. Therefore, the practical applicability of the reverse mode in its original formulation is limited despite the availability of ever larger memory systems. This observation leads to the development of checkpointing schedules to reduce the storage requirements. This article presents the function revolve, which generates checkpointing schedules that are provably optimal with regard to a primary and a secondary criterion. This routine is intended to be used as an explicit   ” controller” for running a time-dependent applications program.}},

@article{jones:1993,
    abstract = {{We present a new algorithm for finding the global minimum of a multivariate function subject to simple bounds. The algorithm is a modification of the standard Lipschitzian approach that eliminates the need to specify a Lipschitz constant. This is done by carrying out simultaneous searches using all possible constants from zero to infinity. On nine standard test functions, the new algorithm converges in fewer function evaluations than most competing methods. The motivation for the new algorithm stems from a different way of looking at the Lipschitz constant. In particular, the Lipschitz constant is viewed as a weighting parameter that indicates how much emphasis to place on global versus local search. In standard Lipschitzian methods, this constant is usually large because it must equal or exceed the maximum rate of change of the objective function. As a result, these methods place a high emphasis on global search and exhibit slow convergence. In contrast, the new algorithm carries out simultaneous searches using all possible constants, and therefore operates at both the global and local level. Once the global part of the algorithm finds the basin of convergence of the optimum, the local part of the algorithm quickly and automatically exploits it. This accounts for the fast convergence of the new algorithm on the test functions.}},

    abstract = {{Multigrid algorithms are developed for systems arising from high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations on unstructured meshes. The algorithms are based on coupling both p- and h-multigrid (ph-multigrid) methods which are used in non-linear or linear forms, and either directly as solvers or as preconditioners to a Newton-Krylov method. The performance of the algorithms are examined in solving the laminar flow over an airfoil configuration. It is shown that the choice of the cycling strategy is crucial in achieving efficient and scalable solvers. For the multigrid solvers, while the order-independent convergence rate is obtained with a proper cycle type, the mesh-independent performance is achieved only if the coarsest problem is solved to a sufficient accuracy. On the other hand, the multigrid preconditioned Newton-GMRES solver appears to be insensitive to this condition and mesh-independent convergence is achieved under the desirable condition that the coarsest problem is solved using a fixed number of multigrid cycles regardless of the size of the problem. It is concluded that the Newton-GMRES solver with the multigrid preconditioning yields the most efficient and robust algorithm among those studied.}},

    abstract = {{The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is widely used to derive low-dimensional models of large and complex systems. One of the main drawback of this method, however, is that it is based on reference data. When they are obtained for one single set of parameter values, the resulting model can reproduce the reference dynamics very accurately but generally lack of robustness away from the reference state. It is therefore crucial to enlarge the validity range of these models beyond the parameter values for which they were derived. This paper presents two strategies based on shape sensitivity analysis to partially address this limitation of the POD for parameters that define the geometry of the problem at hand (design or shape parameters.) We first detail the methodology to compute both the POD modes and their Lagrangian sensitivities with respect to shape parameters. From them, we derive improved reduced-order bases to approximate a class of solutions over a range of parameter values. Secondly, we demonstrate the efficiency and limitations of these approaches on two typical flow problems: (1) the one-dimensional Burgers' equation; (2) the two-dimensional flows past a square cylinder over a range of incidence angles.}},

Many concrete tests have been reported on in the literature that show that several classes of reduced-order models (ROMs) are effective, i.e., an accurate approximate solution can be obtained using very low-dimensional ROMs. Most of these tests involved problems for which the solution depends on only a single parameter appearing in the boundary data. The extension of the techniques used in those tests to the case of multiple parameters is not a straightforward matter. Here, we present, test, and compare two methods for treating, within the context of a class of ROMs, inhomogeneous Dirichlet-type boundary conditions that contain multiple parameters. In this study, we focus on the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach to ROM; however, the issues and results discussed here in the POD context apply equally well to other ROM approaches.}},

    abstract = {{We derive and compute optimal test functions for discontinuous finite element methods. These test functions deliver accuracy in domain-boundary quantities. The resulting  ” BDPG” method achieves higher flux convergence rates than DG. The method applies to linear PDEs and can be extended to nonlinear equations. Obtaining accuracy along domain boundaries is often the primary goal of a numerical simulation. In this work, we show how the test space of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods can be optimized to achieve enhanced boundary accuracy for linear problems. Given some norm in which accuracy is desired, the optimal test functions render the numerical solution the best approximation to the true solution in that norm. For most norms, these test functions would be global in nature. However, for norms emphasizing boundary accuracy, they can be computed in an element-local manner and represent adjoint solutions for the interface fluxes. The resulting accuracy in these interface fluxes propagates globally, leading to convergence rates on the domain boundaries greater than 2p+12p+1. Indeed, if the test functions and interface fluxes are well-resolved, exact boundary fluxes are obtained. Here, we demonstrate these ideas for several Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, including advection–diffusion and linearized Euler problems in both one and two dimensions. An extension of the theory to nonlinear problems will be presented in a future work.}},

    abstract = {{Model reduction methods are usually based on preliminary computations to build the shape function of the reduced order model (ROM) before the computation of the reduced state variables. They are a posteriori approaches. Most of the time these preliminary computations are as complex as the simulation which we want to simplify by the ROM. The reduction method we propose avoids such preliminary computations. It is an a priori approach based on the analysis of some state evolutions, such that all the state evolutions needed to perform the model reduction are described by an approximate ROM. The ROM and the state evolution are simultaneously improved by the method, thanks to an adaptive strategy. Obviously, an initial set of known shape functions can be used to define the ROM to adapt. But it is not necessary. The adaptive procedure includes extensions of the subspace spanned by the shape functions of the ROM and selections of the most relevant shape functions in order to represent the state evolution. The hyperreduction is achieved by selecting a part of the integration points of the finite element model to forecast the evolution of the reduced state variables. Hence both the number of degrees of freedom and the number of integration points are reduced. To perform the adaptive procedure, different computational strategies can be developed. In this paper, we propose an incremental algorithm involving adaptive periods. During these adaptive periods the incremental computation is restarted until a quality criterion is satisfied. This approach is compatible with classical formulations of the equations.}},

    abstract = {{The Gauss–Newton with approximated tensors (GNAT) method is a nonlinear model-reduction method that operates on fully discretized computational models. It achieves dimension reduction by a Petrov–Galerkin projection associated with residual minimization; it delivers computational efficiency by a hyper-reduction procedure based on the 'gappy POD' technique. Originally presented in Ref. [1], where it was applied to implicit nonlinear structural-dynamics models, this method is further developed here and applied to the solution of a benchmark turbulent viscous flow problem. To begin, this paper develops global state-space error bounds that justify the method's design and highlight its advantages in terms of minimizing components of these error bounds. Next, the paper introduces a 'sample mesh' concept that enables a distributed, computationally efficient implementation of the GNAT method in finite-volume-based computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD) codes. The suitability of GNAT for parameterized problems is highlighted with the solution of an academic problem featuring moving discontinuities. Finally, the capability of this method to reduce by orders of magnitude the core-hours required for large-scale CFD computations, while preserving accuracy, is demonstrated with the simulation of turbulent flow over the Ahmed body. For an instance of this benchmark problem with over 17 million degrees of freedom, GNAT outperforms several other nonlinear model-reduction methods, reduces the required computational resources by more than two orders of magnitude, and delivers a solution that differs by less than 1\% from its high-dimensional counterpart.}},

    abstract = {{Solving large-scale PDE-constrained optimization problems presents computational challenges due to the large dimensional set of underlying equations that have to be handled by the optimizer. Recently, projection-based nonlinear reduced-order models have been proposed to be used in place of high-dimensional models in a design optimization procedure. The dimensionality of the solution space is reduced using a reduced-order basis constructed by Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. In the case of nonlinear equations, however, this is not sufficient to ensure that the cost associated with the optimization procedure does not scale with the high dimension. To achieve that goal, an additional reduction step, hyper-reduction is applied. Then, solving the resulting reduced set of equations only requires a reduced dimensional domain and large speedups can be achieved. In the case of design optimization, it is shown in this paper that an additional approximation of the objective function is required. This is achieved by the construction of a surrogate objective using radial basis functions. The proposed method is illustrated with two applications: the shape optimization of a simplified nozzle inlet model and the design optimization of a chemical reaction.}},

Grid quality, truncation errors added and reduced by adaptation, and current research areas are discussed. Qualitative analysis of grids produced by the adaptive algorithms reveals that conventional standards of grid quality are violated frequently in regions where solution improvement due to adaptation is evident. Alignment of the grid with solution features is shown to be a more appropriate indication of mesh improvement than cell shape.

Features of a learning environment do not act in isolation; other factors such as the concepts or skills to be learned, individual characteristics, the learning experience, and the interaction experience all play a role in shaping the learning process and its outcomes. Through Project Science Space, we have been trying to identify, use, and evaluate immersive virtual reality's affordances as a means to facilitate the mastery of complex, abstract concepts. In doing so, we are beginning to understand the interplay between virtual reality's features and other important factors in shaping the learning process and learning outcomes for this type of material.

    abstract = {{In the past, the term e-learning referred to any method of learning that used electronic delivery methods. With the advent of the Internet however, e-learning has evolved and the term is now most commonly used to refer to online courses. A multitude of systems are now available to manage and deliver learning content online. While these have proved popular, they are often single-user learning environments which provide little in the way of interaction or stimulation for the student. As the concept of lifelong learning now becomes a reality and thus more and more people are partaking in online courses, researchers are constantly exploring innovative techniques to motivate online students and enhance the e-learning experience. This article presents our research in this area and the resulting development of CLEV-R, a Collaborative Learning Environment with Virtual Reality. This web-based system uses Virtual Reality (VR) and multimedia and provides communication tools to support collaboration among students. In this article, we describe the features of CLEV-R, its adaptation for mobile devices and present the findings from an initial evaluation.}},

Various relevant constructs and their measurement factors were identified to examine how desktop VR enhances learning and the fit of the hypothesized model was analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results supported the indirect effect of VR features to the learning outcomes, which was mediated by the interaction experience and the learning experience. Learning experience which was individually measured by the psychological factors, that is, presence, motivation, cognitive benefits, control and active learning, and reflective thinking took central stage in affecting the learning outcomes in the desktop VR-based learning environment. The moderating effect of student characteristics such as spatial ability and learning style was also examined. The results show instructional designers and VR software developers how to improve the learning effectiveness and further strengthen their desktop VR-based learning implementation. Through this research, an initial theoretical model of the determinants of learning effectiveness in a desktop VR-based learning environment is contributed.}},

Consequently, the design process is significantly different from a pure mathematical optimization. This paper presents a decision support platform for interactive design that integrates mathematical optimization with human interaction based on VE-Suite. Current efforts are geared toward seamlessly linking high fidelity models, numerical optimization and human interaction to improve efficiency and quality in system performance. The designer's interaction causes the optimization process to dynamically change by adding, deleting, and modifying objectives, constraints, and other parameters that govern the process. As an illustration, a coal pipe design case is used to demonstrate the new platform's capabilities. The case has demonstrated that adding user interaction into the design process has the potential to improve design efficiency and quality.}},

    abstract = {{This study focuses on finding the optimal layout of fluidic devices subjected to incompressible flow at low Reynolds numbers. The proposed approach uses a levelset method to describe the fluid-solid interface geometry. The flow field is modeled by the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations and discretized by the extended finite element method (XFEM). The no-slip condition along the fluid-solid interface is enforced via a stabilized Lagrange multiplier method. Unlike the commonly used porosity approach, the XFEM approach does not rely on a material interpolation scheme, which allows for more flexibility in formulating the design problems. Further, it mitigates shortcomings of the porosity approach, including spurious pressure diffusion through solid material, strong dependency of the accuracy of the boundary enforcement with respect to the model parameters which may affect the optimization results, and poor boundary resolution. Numerical studies verify that the proposed method is able to recover optimization results obtained with the porosity approach. Further, it is demonstrated that the XFEM approach yields physical results for problems that cannot be solved with the porosity approach.}},

    abstract = {{We develop and test an algorithmic approach to the boundary design of elastic structures. The goal of our approach is two-fold: first, to develop a method which allows one to rapidly solve the two-dimensional Lam\'{e} equations in arbitrary domains and compute, for example, the stresses, and second, to develop a systematic way of modifying the design to optimize chosen properties. At the core, our approach relies on two distinct steps. Given a design, we first apply an explicit jump immersed interface method to compute the stresses for a given design shape. We then use a narrow band level set method to perturb this shape and progress towards an improved design. The equations of 2D linear elastostatics in the displacement formulation on arbitrary domains are solved quickly by domain embedding and the use of fast elastostatic solvers. This effectively reduces the dimensionality of the problem by one. Once the stresses are found, the level set method, which represents the design structure through an embedded implicit function, is used in the second step to alter the shape, with velocities depending on the stresses in the current design. Criteria are provided for advancing the shape in an appropriate direction and for correcting the evolving shape when given constraints are violated.}},

    abstract = {{In topology optimization of structures, materials and mechanisms, parametrization of geometry is often performed by a grey-scale density-like interpolation function. In this paper we analyze and compare the various approaches to this concept in the light of variational bounds on effective properties of composite materials. This allows us to derive simple necessary conditions for the possible realization of grey-scale via composites, leading to a physical interpretation of all feasible designs as well as the optimal design. Thus it is shown that the so-called artificial interpolation model in many circumstances actually falls within the framework of microstructurally based models. Single material and multi-material structural design in elasticity as well as in multi-physics problems is discussed.}},

    abstract = {{Optimal shape design of structural elements based on boundary variations results in final designs that are topologically equivalent to the initial choice of design, and general, stable computational schemes for this approach often require some kind of remeshing of the finite element approximation of the analysis problem. This paper presents a methodology for optimal shape design where both these drawbacks can be avoided. The method is related to modern production techniques and consists of computing the optimal distribution in space of an anisotropic material that is constructed by introducing an infimum of periodically distributed small holes in a given homogeneous, isotropic material, with the requirement that the resulting structure can carry the given loads as well as satisfy other design requirements. The computation of effective material properties for the anisotropic material is carried out using the method of homogenization. Computational results are presented and compared with results obtained by boundary variations.}},

This enables the user to be immersed in this world via user position tracking devices and to interact with the data objects in the world in intuitive ways. This paper describes a selection of VR simulations for engineering applications implemented in CLRC which demonstrate the potential of VR interaction techniques to offer quicker and possibly better understanding of spatial relationships and temporal patterns inherent in large data sets. Two of the case studies have been implemented to support engineers communicate and review their designs with scientists, managers and manufacturers and to plan their assembly and maintenance work in hazardous physical environments. The other two applications are visualisation case studies based on data sets generated by computational engineering simulations. The case studies are 'real world' applications, involving end-users of large or complex data sets. Insight gained into the user interaction requirements through the implementation and user comments is guiding ongoing research and development activity and this is discussed briefly.}},

@article{jayaram:2007,
    abstract = {{In this paper, we report on two engineering case studies that have been conducted as part of a Virtual Assembly Technology Consortium. The objectives of the case studies were to determine if immersive virtual assembly capabilities allow industry assembly situations to be modelled and studied realistically, and to demonstrate the downstream value of the virtual assembly capabilities in areas such as ergonomics, assembly installation, process planning, installation, and serviceability. What is of special significance is that instead of modelling simplified problems or perceived representative situations, the case studies were constructed from actual assembly floor projects and situations encountered at industry member sites and with considerable participation from industry engineers and manufacturing shop floor personnel. Based on the success of the case studies, the consortium members inferred that virtual assembly methods are poised to move out of the realm of special projects and test scenarios to deployment in the actual design and manufacturing cycle. However, in order to be truly accepted in industry, there are still issues to be addressed in terms of ease of use, portability of the applications, and preparation of the models for the evaluations. Thus, the case studies added a new dimension to the exploration and understanding of how this new technology could be of practical value in industry.}},

It combines the best features of structured and unstructured grid methods to attain computational efficiency and geometric flexibility; it utilizes the concept of discontinuous and high-order local representations to achieve conservation and high accuracy; and it is based on the finite-difference formulation for simplicity. Universal reconstructions are obtained by distributing unknown and flux points in a geometrically similar manner for all unstructured cells. Placements of these points with various orders of accuracy are given for the triangular elements. Accuracy studies of the method are carried out with the two-dimensional linear wave equation and Burgers' equation, and each order of accuracy is verified numerically. Numerical solutions of plane electromagnetic waves incident on perfectly conducting circular cylinders are presented and compared with the exact solutions to demonstrate the capability of the method. Excellent agreement has been found. The method is much simpler than the discontinuous Galerkin and spectral volume methods for unstructured grids.}},

    abstract = {{Response surfaces are frequently used as approximations in sequential optimization techniques, multidisciplinary optimization and reliability oriented analysis. In this paper several techniques will be exploited to construct response surfaces using both function values and corresponding derivatives, i.e. gradient-enhanced response surfaces (GERS). The way response surfaces are constructed on both function values and derivatives is not well crystallized. In particular how information on function values and derivatives must be weighted against each other is a point of discussion. To a certain extent, the best method seems to depend on the purpose of the response surface. The technique that is studied in this paper treats the response surface building as a multi-objective optimization problem. This enables a well-controlled balance between accuracy of the approximate gradients as well as the approximate function values. The method is studied for a series of test problems and compared to other techniques. This paper addresses in particularly the effect of the plan of experiment on accuracy.}},

On quadrilateral elements, Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto points are both good interpolation and integration points; on triangles, analogous points have not yet been found. In this paper, a promising set of points for the triangle that were only available for polynomial degree N ≤ 5 are used. However, the derivation of these points is generalized to obtain degree N ≤ 7 points, which are referred to as cubature points because their selection is based on their integration accuracy. The diagonal-mass-matrix (DMM) triangular-spectral-element (TSE) method based on these points can be used for any set of equations and any type of domain. Because these cubature points integrate up to order 2N along the element boundaries and yield a diagonal mass matrix, they allow the triangular spectral elements to compete with quadrilateral spectral elements in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, while offering more geometric flexibility in the choice of grids. It is shown how to implement this DMM TSE for a variety of applications involving elliptic and hyperbolic equations on different domains. The DMM TSE method yields comparable accuracy to the exact integration (non-DMM) TSE method, while being far more efficient for time-dependent problems.}},

@article{liu:1998,
    abstract = {{This paper is concerned with two important elements in the high-order accurate spatial discretization of finite-volume equations over arbitrary grids. One element is the integration of basis functions over arbitrary domains, which is used in expressing various spatial integrals in terms of discrete unknowns. The other consists of quadrature approximations to those integrals. Only polynomial basis functions applied to polyhedral and polygonal grids are treated here. Nontriangular polygonal faces are subdivided into a union of planar triangular facets, and the resulting triangulated polyhedron is subdivided into a union of tetrahedra. The straight line segment, triangle, and tetrahedron are thus the fundamental shapes that are the building blocks for all integrations and quadrature approximations. Integrals of products up to the fifth order are derived in a unified manner for the three fundamental shapes in terms of the position vectors of vertices. Results are given both in terms of tensor products and products of Cartesian coordinates. The exact polynomial integrals are used to obtain symmetric quadrature approximations of any degree of precision up to five for arbitrary integrals over the three fundamental domains. Using a coordinate-free formulation, simple and rational procedures are developed to derive virtually all quadrature formulas, including some previously unpublished. Four symmetry groups of quadrature points are introduced to derive Gauss formulas, while their limiting forms are used to derive Lobatto formulas. Representative Gauss and Lobatto formulas are tabulated. The relative efficiency of their application to polyhedral and polygonal grids is detailed. The extension to higher degrees of precision is discussed.}},

One of the challenges of implementing RSNK methods is the efficient solution of the linear subproblems, which involve the reduced Hessian. This paper explores inexact Hessian-vector products to improve the efficiency of these subproblems. The reduced-Hessian-vector products, which are required by the Krylov solver in RSNK, can be determined by solving two second-order adjoint equations. To reduce computational cost, we consider the approximate (i.e. inexact) solution of the second-order adjoints. We present bounds for the second-order adjoint tolerances that ensure the Hessian-vector product remains sufficiently accurate for inexact-Krylov methods. The bounds involve the 2-norm of the state and first-order adjoint sensitivities, and we provide an inexpensive Lanczos algorithm to estimate these matrix norms. Using numerical experiments, we investigate the proposed RSNK algorithm and compare it to other optimization algorithms.}},

@article{notay:2000,
    abstract = {{We analyze the conjugate gradient (CG) method with preconditioning slightly variable from one iteration to the next. To maintain the optimal convergence properties, we consider a variant proposed by Axelsson that performs an explicit orthogonalization of the search directions vectors. For this method, which we refer to as  flexible  CG, we develop a theoretical analysis that shows that the convergence rate is essentially independent of the variations in the preconditioner as long as the latter are kept sufficiently small. We further discuss the real convergence rate on the basis of some heuristic arguments supported by numerical experiments. Depending on the eigenvalue distribution corresponding to the fixed reference preconditioner, several situations have to be distinguished. In some cases, the convergence is as fast with truncated versions of the algorithm or even with the standard CG method, whereas quite large variations are allowed without too much penalty. In other cases, the flexible variant effectively outperforms the standard method, while the need for truncation limits the size of the variations that can be reasonably allowed.}},

@article{kenway:2013,
    abstract = {{Aeroelastic systems achieve the best performance when the aerodynamic shape and structural sizing are optimized concurrently, but such an optimization is challenging when high-fidelity aerodynamic and structural models are required. This paper addresses this challenge through several significant improvements. Fully coupled NewtonKrylov methods are presented for the solution of aerostructural systems and for the corresponding adjoint systems. The coupled adjoint method presented can compute gradients with respect to thousands of multidisciplinary design variables accurately and efficiently. This is enabled by several improvements in the computation of the multidisciplinary terms in the coupled adjoint. The parallel scalability of the methods is demonstrated for a full aircraft configuration using an Euler computational fluid dynamics model with more than 8 million variables and a detailed structural finite element model of the wing with millions of degrees of freedom. The coupled Newton-Krylov methods are shown to improve the convergence rate of both the aerostructural solution and the coupled adjoint derivative computations. Gradient computations of aerodynamic and structural functions with respect to both aerodynamic shape and structural sizing variables are verified, and scaling is demonstrated to thousands variables. The accuracy and scalability of the presented methods make it possible to perform aerostructural optimizations of full aircraft configurations with respect to hundreds of external shape and structural sizing design variables, leading to optimal aeroelastic tailoring.}},

    abstract = {{Many scientific phenomena are now investigated by complex computer models or codes. A computer experiment is a number of runs of the code with various inputs. A feature of many computer experiments is that the output is deterministic--rerunning the code with the same inputs gives identical observations. Often, the codes are computationally expensive to run, and a common objective of an experiment is to fit a cheaper predictor of the output to the data. Our approach is to model the deterministic output as the realization of a stochastic process, thereby providing a statistical basis for designing experiments (choosing the inputs) for efficient prediction. With this model, estimates of uncertainty of predictions are also available. Recent work in this area is reviewed, a number of applications are discussed, and we demonstrate our methodology with an example.}},

    abstract = {{This article is concerned with the problem of predicting a deterministic response function yo over a multidimensional domain T, given values of yo and all of its first derivatives at a set of design sites (points) in T. The intended application is to computer experiments in which yo is an output from a computer model of a physical system and each point in T represents a particular configuration of the input parameters. It is assumed that the first derivatives are already available (e.g., from a sensitivity analysis) or can be produced by the code that implements the model. A Bayesian approach in which the random function that represents prior uncertainty about yo is taken to be a stationary Gaussian stochastic process is used. The calculations needed to update the prior given observations of yo and its first derivatives at the design sites are given and are illustrated in a small example. The issue of experimental design is also discussed, in particular the criterion of maximizing the reduction in entropy, which leads to a kind of D optimality. It is shown that, for certain classes of correlation functions in which the intersite correlations are very weak, D-optimal designs necessarily maximize the minimim distance between design sites. A simulated annealing algorithm is described for constructing such maximin distance designs. An example is given based on a demonstration model of eight inputs and one output, in which predictions based on a maximin design, a Latin hypercube design, and two compromise designs are evaluated and compared.}},

We consider the problem of determining a reduced model of an initial value problem that spans all important initial conditions, and pose the task of determining appropriate training sets for reduced-basis construction as a sequence of optimization problems. We show that, under certain assumptions, these optimization problems have an explicit solution in the form of an eigenvalue problem, yielding an efficient model reduction algorithm that scales well to systems with states of high dimension. Furthermore, tight upper bounds are given for the error in the outputs of the reduced models. The reduction methodology is demonstrated for a large-scale contaminant transport problem.

    abstract = {{We present a technique for the evaluation of linear-functional outputs of parametrized elliptic partial differential equations in the context of deployed (in service) systems. Deployed systems require real-time and certified output prediction in support of immediate and safe (feasible) action. The two essential components of our approach are (i) rapidly, uniformly convergent reduced-basis approximations, and (ii) associated rigorous and sharp a posteriori error bounds; in both components we exploit affine parametric structure and offline–online computational decompositions to provide real-time deployed response. In this paper we extend our methodology to the parametrized steady incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. We invoke the Brezzi–Rappaz–Raviart theory for analysis of variational approximations of non-linear partial differential equations to construct rigorous, quantitative, sharp, inexpensive a posteriori error estimators. The crucial new contribution is offline–online computational procedures for calculation of (a) the dual norm of the requisite residuals, (b) an upper bound for the 'L4(Ω)-H1(Ω)' Sobolev embedding continuity constant, (c) a lower bound for the Babu\v{s}ka inf–sup stability 'constant,' and (d) the adjoint contributions associated with the output. Numerical results for natural convection in a cavity confirm the rapid convergence of the reduced-basis approximation, the good effectivity of the associated a posteriori error bounds in the energy and output norms, and the rapid deployed response.

Furthermore, our decisions must be based on total life cycle cost. The approach NASA is taking to meet these challenges is through the development of an Intelligent Synthesis Environment that integrates advanced computing and human interaction with the computing environment; virtual presence and product development; knowledge-based engineering and computational intelligence; and advanced analysis and design methods to create a seamless environment enabling new levels of distributed collaborative teaming.

The currently most-favored pedagogical model for teaching design, project-based learning (PBL), is explored next, along with available assessment data on its success. Two contexts for PBL are emphasized: first-year cornerstone courses and globally dispersed PBL courses.

    abstract = {{Background Modeling is a pervasive feature of engineering that is rarely taught explicitly to engineering students. The implicit inclusion of modeling often results in conceptions held by students of models based on the everyday use of the term that neglects important predictive types of models. Purpose We studied the effectiveness of an explicit modeling module designed to broaden student understandings of various approaches to and applications of modeling. Design/Method A two-phase analysis of student conceptions was undertaken. Phase I analyzed the conceptions of an experimental group before and after they were taught an explicit modeling module. Phase II added a comparison group at a second institution. Results A significant shift was observed for engineering students who were explicitly taught a modeling module. Student-held conceptions were predominantly descriptive-centric (e.g., physical models) throughout the investigation with an added focus on predictive (e.g., mathematical) modeling after completing the modeling module. These results were consistent for a comparison group. Conclusions Explicit learning experiences about models and the modeling process need to be embedded into the engineering curriculum, specifically in the teaching of engineering design. Teaching modeling will improve student use and understanding of modeling as an important and pervasive engineering tool.}},

@article{bechert:1997,
    abstract = {{Previous research has established that surfaces with tiny ribs (riblets) aligned in the streamwise direction can reduce the turbulent wall-shear stress below that of a smooth surface. Typical skin-friction reductions have been found to be about 5\%. The results of the present investigation, however, demonstrate a considerable improvement over this value. This improvement is achieved by a systematic experimental optimization which has been guided by theoretical concepts.A key feature of our experiments is the utilization of an oil channel. Previous experiments in wind tunnels had to contend with very small riblet dimensions which typically had a lateral rib spacing of about 0.5 mm or less. By contrast, in our oil channel, the ribs can have a lateral spacing of between about 2 and 10 mm. This increased size of the surface structures enables test surfaces to be manufactured with conventional mechanical methods, and it also enables us to build test surfaces with adjustable geometry. In addition, the Berlin oil channel has a novel shear stress balance with an unprecedented accuracy of ±0.3\%. This latter feature is a prerequisite for a systematic experimental optimization.In the present investigation, surfaces with longitudinal ribs and additional slits are studied. The experiments cover a fairly large range of parameters so that the drag reduction potential of a surface with ribs and\&sol;or slits is worked out conclusively. A large parameter range is made possible because of the adjustability of the surfaces as well as the automatic operation of the oil channel. In particular, the following tests were run:(i) Shear stress measurements with conventional riblet configurations, i.e. with triangular and semi-circular grooves, have been carried out. These measurements were necessary in order to establish the connection between our oil channel data and previous data from wind tunnels. As was previously established, we found a drag reduction of about 5\%.(ii) An adjustable surface with longitudinal blade ribs and with slits was built and tested. Both groove depth and slit width could be varied separately and continuously during the experiment. It turned out, that slits in the surface did not contribute to the drag reduction. Nevertheless, these investigations show how perforated surfaces (e.g. for boundary-layer control) can be designed for minimal parasitic drag. On the other hand, with closed slits, an optimal groove depth for the rib surface could be determined, i.e. half of the lateral rib spacing. For this configuration, we found an 8.7 skin-friction reduction. By carefully eliminating deleterious effects (caused by little gaps, etc.), the skin-friction reduction could be improved to a record value of 9.9\%.(iii) A quantitative comparison between theory and experiment was carried out. The theory is based on the assumption that riblets impede the fluctuating turbulent crossflow near the wall. In this way, momentum transfer and shear stress are reduced. The simplified theoretical model proposed by Luchini (1992) is supported by the present experiments.(iv) For technological applications of riblets, e.g. on long-range commercial aircraft, the above thin-blade ribs are not practical. Therefore, we have devised a surface that combines a significantly improved performance (8.2 \%) with a geometry which exhibits better durability and enables previously developed manufacturing methods for plastic riblet film production to be used. Our riblet geometry exhibits trapezoidal grooves with wedge-like ribs. The flat floor of the trapezoidal grooves permits an undistorted visibility through the transparent riblet film which is essential for crack inspection on aircraft.}},

    abstract = {{Abstract Variational four-dimensional (4D) data assimilation is performed using an adiabatic version of the National Meteorological Center (NMC) baroclinic spectral primitive equation model with operationally analyzed fields as well as simulated datasets. Two limited-memory quasi-Newton minimization techniques were used to iteratively find the minimum of a cost function, with the NMC forecast as a constraint. The cost function consists of a weighted square sum of the differences between the model forecast and observations over a time interval. In all the experiments described in this paper, observations are available for all degrees of freedom of the model. The derivation of the adjoint of the discretized adiabatic NMC spectral model is presented. The creation of this adjoint model allows the gradient of the cost function with respect to the initial conditions to be computed using a single backward-in-time integration of the adjoint equations. As an initial evaluation of the variational data-assimilation procedure, an assimilation system with a low-resolution version of the NMC spectral model was tested using fields from a Rossby-Haurwitz-wave solution as observations. The results were encouraging, with a significant reduction in the magnitudes of both the cost function and the norm of its gradient during the minimization process. In particular, the high-frequency noise exhibited in the rms of the divergence field, produced by random perturbation in the initial conditions, is largely eliminated after the variational data assimilation. The performance of the assimilation scheme was examined in a more realistic configuration using the adiabatic NMC spectral model truncated at T40. Both operationally analyzed observations, consisting of vorticity, divergence, temperature, surface pressure and moisture fields (distributed at two time levels separated by a 6-h time interval), and model-generated data were variationally assimilated. The effect of the number of observation fields in time on the convergence rate of the minimization and the impacts due to the inclusion of the horizontal diffusion and the surface drag in the model and its adjoint on the convergence rate and the accuracy of the retrieval are addressed.}},

    abstract = {{We present a general formulation for inverting frequency? or time?domain electromagnetic data using an all?at?once approach. In this methodology, the forward modeling equations are incorporated as constraints and, thus, we need to solve a constrained optimization problem where the parameters are the electromagnetic fields, the conductivity model, and a set of Lagrange multipliers. This leads to a much larger problem than the traditional unconstrained formulation where only the conductivities are sought. Nevertheless, experience shows that the constrained problem can be solved faster than the unconstrained one. The primary reasons are that the forward problem does not have to be solved exactly until the very end of the optimization process, and that permitting the fields to be away from their constrained values in the initial stages introduces flexibility so that a stationary point of the objective function is found more quickly. In this paper, we outline the all?at?once approach and apply it to electromagnetic problems in both frequency and time domains. This is facilitated by a unified representation for forward modeling for these two types of data. The optimization problem is solved by finding a stationary point of the Lagrangian. Numerically, this leads to a nonlinear system that is solved iteratively using a Gauss?Newton strategy. At each iteration, a large, indefinite matrix is inverted, and we discuss how this can be accomplished. As a test, we invert frequency?domain synthetic data from a grounded electrode system that emulates a field CSAMT survey. For the time domain, we invert borehole data obtained from a current loop on thesurface.}},

    abstract = {{The control of quantum dynamics via specially tailored laser pulses is a long-standing goal in physics and chemistry. Partly, this dream has come true, as sophisticated pulse-shaping experiments allow us to coherently control product ratios of chemical reactions. The theoretical design of the laser pulse to transfer an initial state to a given final state can be achieved with the help of quantum optimal control theory (QOCT). This tutorial provides an introduction to QOCT. It shows how the control equations defining such an optimal pulse follow from the variation of a properly defined functional. We explain the most successful schemes to solve these control equations and show how to incorporate additional constraints in the pulse design. The algorithms are then applied to simple quantum systems and the obtained pulses are analysed. Besides the traditional final-time control methods, the tutorial also presents an algorithm and an example to handle time-dependent control targets.}},

Level-set methods can be categorized with respect to the level-set-function parameterization, the geometry mapping, the physical/mechanical model, the information and the procedure to update the design and the applied regularization. Different approaches for each of these interlinked components are outlined and compared. Based on this categorization, the convergence behavior of the optimization process is discussed, as well as control over the slope and smoothness of the level-set function, hole nucleation and the relation of level-set methods to other topology optimization methods. The importance of numerical consistency for understanding and studying the behavior of proposed methods is highlighted. This review concludes with recommendations for future research.}},

This paper describes a controlled experiment for evaluating an important aspect of TDD: In TDD, programmers write functional tests before the corresponding implementation code. The experiment was conducted with undergraduate students. While the experiment group applied a test-first strategy, the control group applied a more conventional development technique, writing tests after the implementation. Both groups followed an incremental process, adding new features one at a time and regression testing them. We found that test-first students on average wrote more tests and, in turn, students who wrote more tests tended to be more productive. We also observed that the minimum quality increased linearly with the number of programmer tests, independent of the development strategy employed.}},

They preserve the rapid local convergence of Newton's method at a significantly reduced cost per step by successively approximating the system Jacobian though low-rank updates. We analyze two variants of the recently proposed adjoint Broyden update, which for the first time combines the classical least change property with heredity on affine systems. However, the new update does require, the evaluation of so-called adjoint vectors, namely products of the transposed Jacobian with certain dual direction vectors. The resulting quasi-Newton method is linear contravariant in the sense of Deuflhard (Newton methods for nonlinear equations. Springer, Heidelberg, 2006) and it is shown here to be locally and q-superlinearly convergent. Our numerical results on a range of test problems demonstrate that the new method usually outperforms Newton's and Broyden's method in terms of runtime and iterations count, respectively.}},

    abstract = {{Consider the discretization of a partial differential equation (PDE) and an integral functional that depends on the PDE solution. The discretization is dual consistent if it leads to a discrete dual problem that is a consistent approximation of the corresponding continuous dual problem. Consequently, a dual-consistent discretization is a synthesis of the so-called discrete-adjoint and continuous-adjoint approaches. We highlight the impact of dual consistency on summation-by-parts (SBP) finite-difference discretizations of steady-state PDEs; specifically, superconvergent functionals and accurate functional error estimates. In the case of functional superconvergence, the discrete-adjoint variables do not need to be computed, since dual consistency on its own is sufficent. Numerical examples demonstrate that dual-consistent schemes significantly outperform dual-inconsistent schemes in terms of functional accuracy and error-estimate effectiveness. The dual-consistent and dual-inconsisent discretizations have similar computational costs, so dual consistency leads to improved efficiency. To illustrate the dual consistency analysis of SBP schemes, we thoroughly examine a discretization of the Euler equations of gas dynamics, including the treatment of the boundary conditions, numerical dissipation, interface penalties, and quadrature by SBP norms.}},

    abstract = {{A complementary experimental and numerical investigation was performed to study the three-dimensional flow structures and interactions of a finite-span synthetic jet in a crossflow at a chord-based Reynolds number of 100,000 and a 0° angle of attack. Six blowing ratios in the range of 0.2–1.2 were considered. Experiments were conducted on a finite wing with a cross-sectional profile of NACA 4421, where particle-image velocimetry data were collected at the centre jet. To complement the experiments, three-dimensional numerical simulations were performed, where the numerical set-up matched not only the physical parameters (e.g. free stream) but also the physical dimensions (e.g. orientation and location of the jet. For the low blowing ratio cases, spatial non-uniformities developed, due to the finite span of the slit, which led to the formation of small and organized secondary structures or a streak-like pattern in the mean flow. On the other hand, for the high blowing ratio range, turbulent vortical structures were dominant, leading to larger spanwise structures, with a larger spanwise wavelength. Moreover, the phase-locked flow fields exhibited a train of counter-rotating coherent vortices that lifted off the surface as they advected downstream. In the mid-blowing ratio range, combined features of the low range (near the slit) and high range (in downstream locations) were found, where a pair of counter-rotating vortices issued in the same jet cycle collided with each other. In all cases, the spanwise extent of the secondary coherent structures reduced with downstream distance with a larger decrease at higher blowing ratios. Similar observations were made in earlier studies on finite-span synthetic jets in quiescent conditions.}},

    abstract = {{A traditional subject in statistical physics is the linear response of a molecular dynamical system to changes in an external forcing agency, e.g. the Ohmic response of an electrical conductor to an applied electric field. For molecular systems the linear response matrices, such as the electrical conductivity, can be represented by  Green–Kubo formulae  as improper time-integrals of 2-time correlation functions in the system. Recently, Ruelle has extended the Green–Kubo formalism to describe the statistical, steady-state response of a 'sufficiently chaotic' nonlinear dynamical system to changes in its parameters. This formalism potentially has a number of important applications. For instance, in studies of global warming one wants to calculate the response of climate-mean temperature to a change in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. In general, a  climate sensitivity  is defined as the linear response of a long-time average to changes in external forces. We show that Ruelle's linear response formula can be computed by an  ensemble adjoint  technique and that this algorithm is equivalent to a more standard ensemble adjoint method proposed by Lea, Allen and Haine to calculate climate sensitivities. In a numerical implementation for the 3-variable, chaotic Lorenz model it is shown that the two methods perform very similarly. However, because of a power-law tail in the histogram of adjoint gradients their sum over ensemble members becomes a  L\'{e}vy flight , and the central limit theorem breaks down. The law of large numbers still holds and the ensemble-average converges to the desired sensitivity, but only very slowly, as the number of samples is increased. We discuss the implications of this example more generally for ensemble adjoint techniques and for the important practical issue of calculating climate sensitivities.}},

It was conjectured in that paper, based on the numerical evidence available at that time, that the minimum drag of a constant mass flux channel flow might in fact be that of the laminar flow. This conjecture turned out to be false; Min et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 558, 2006, 309318) discovered a curious control strategy which in fact reduces the time-averaged drag to sub-laminar levels. The present paper establishes rigorously that the power of the control input applied at the walls is always larger than the power saved (due to drag reduction below the laminar level) for any possible control distribution, including that proposed by Min et al. (2006), thus establishing that, energetically (that is accounting for the power saved due to drag reduction and the power exerted by application of the control), the optimal control solution is necessarily to relaminarize the flow.}},

    abstract = {{Direct numerical simulations (DNS) and optimal control theory are used in a predictive control setting to determine controls that effectively reduce the turbulent kinetic energy and drag of a turbulent flow in a plane channel at Reτ = 100 and Reτ = 180. Wall transpiration (unsteady blowing\&sol;suction) with zero net mass flux is used as the control. The algorithm used for the control optimization is based solely on the control objective and the nonlinear partial differential equation governing the flow, with no ad hoc assumptions other than the finite prediction horizon, T, over which the control is optimized.Flow relaminarization, accompanied by a drag reduction of over 50\%, is obtained in some of the control cases with the predictive control approach in direct numerical simulations of subcritical turbulent channel flows. Such performance far exceeds what has been obtained to date in similar flows (using this type of actuation) via adaptive strategies such as neural networks, intuition-based strategies such as opposition control, and the so-called 'suboptimal' strategies, which involve optimizations over a vanishingly small prediction horizon T+ → 0. To achieve flow relaminarization in the predictive control approach, it is shown that it is necessary to optimize the controls over a sufficiently long prediction horizon T+ \&gsim; 25. Implications of this result are discussed.The predictive control algorithm requires full flow field information and is computationally expensive, involving iterative direct numerical simulations. It is, therefore, impossible to implement this algorithm directly in a practical setting. However, these calculations allow us to quantify the best possible system performance given a certain class of flow actuation and to qualify how optimized controls correlate with the near-wall coherent structures believed to dominate the process of turbulence production in wall-bounded flows. Further, various approaches have been proposed to distil practical feedback schemes from the predictive control approach without the suboptimal approximation, which is shown in the present work to restrict severely the effectiveness of the resulting control algorithm. The present work thus represents a further step towards the determination of optimally effective yet implementable control strategies for the mitigation or enhancement of the consequential effects of turbulence.}},

Analysis is perfomed on integrations of a quasi-geostrophic (QG) model whose internal low-frequency variability is realistic. Specifically, the sensitivity of the QG-model PNA and NAO patterns have been made from a large set of five-day integrations of the adjoint of the QG-model, linearized about time-varying basic-state solutions of the model. the sensitivity perturbations are initially located well upstream of the pattern of low-frequency variability and propagate downstream by wave dynamics, gaining energy through both barotropic and baroclinic processes. For the PNA pattern, it was found that variations in sensitivity were associated with fluctuations in the strength of the jet across the North Pacific. For the NAO pattern, it was found that fluctuations in sensitivity were correlated with the strength of the PNA pattern, the more sensitive NAO basic states having negative PNA index. This analysis has identified fairly distinct paths in phase space associated with predictable and unpredictable transitions, qualitatively similar to that found in the three-component Lorenz model. Predictability of climate-change problems is also investigated. the results from four different climate integrations in which an additional time-invariant forcing is added to the model equations are presented. QG simulations show that the influence of a forcing proportional to the mean sensitivity pattern induces a stronger change in the probability distribution of the PNA pattern than an equivalent amplitude forcing which directly projects onto the PNA pattern itself.}},

    abstract = {{This paper addresses some fundamental methodological issues concerning the sensitivity analysis of chaotic geophysical systems. We show, using the Lorenz system as an example, that a na\"{i}ve approach to variational ( ” adjoint”) sensitivity analysis is of limited utility. Applied to trajectories which are long relative to the predictability time scales of the system, cumulative error growth means that adjoint results diverge exponentially from the  ” macroscopic climate sensitivity”(that is, the sensitivity of time-averaged properties of the system to finite-amplitude perturbations). This problem occurs even for time-averaged quantities and given infinite computing resources. Alternatively, applied to very short trajectories, the adjoint provides an incorrect estimate of the sensitivity, even if averaged over large numbers of initial conditions, because a finite time scale is required for the model climate to respond fully to certain perturbations. In the Lorenz (1963) system, an intermediate time scale is found on which an ensemble of adjoint gradients can give a reasonably accurate (O(10\%)) estimate of the macroscopic climate sensitivity. While this ensemble-adjoint approach is unlikely to be reliable for more complex systems, it may provide useful guidance in identifying important parameter-combinations to be explored further through direct finite-amplitude perturbations.}},

We then show that the extraction operator and B\'{e}zier elements provide an element structure for isogeometric analysis that can be easily incorporated into existing finite element codes, without any changes to element form and assembly algorithms, and standard data processing arrays.

It is found that weakly enforced conditions are effective and superior to strongly enforced conditions. The numerical tests involve low-order finite elements and a quadratic NURBS basis utilized in the Isogeometric Analysis approach. The convergence of the mean velocity profile for a turbulent channel flow suggests that weak no-slip conditions behave very much like a wall function model, although the design of the boundary condition is based purely on numerical, rather than physical or empirical, conditions.}},

@article{martins:2013,
    abstract = {{<p>Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) is a field of research that studies the application of numerical optimization techniques to the design of engineering systems involving multiple disciplines or components. Since the inception of MDO, various methods (architectures) have been developed and applied to solve MDO problems. This paper provides a survey of all the architectures that have been presented in the literature so far. All architectures are explained in detail using a unified description that includes optimization problem statements, diagrams, and detailed algorithms. The diagrams show both data and process flow through the multidisciplinary system and computational elements, which facilitates the understanding of the various architectures, and how they relate to each other. A classification of the MDO architectures based on their problem formulations and decomposition strategies is also provided, and the benefits and drawbacks of the architectures are discussed from both a theoretical and experimental perspective. For each architecture, several applications to the solution of engineering design problems are cited. The result is a comprehensive but straightforward introduction to MDO for non-specialists, and a reference detailing all current MDO architectures for specialists.</p>}},

Trilinos addresses two fundamental issues of developing software for these problems: (i) Providing a streamlined process and set of tools for development of new algorithmic implementations and (ii) promoting interoperability of independently developed software. Trilinos uses a two-level software structure designed around collections of packages. A Trilinos package is an integral unit usually developed by a small team of experts in a particular algorithms area such as algebraic preconditioners, nonlinear solvers, etc. Packages exist underneath the Trilinos top level, which provides a common look-and-feel, including configuration, documentation, licensing, and bug-tracking. Here we present the overall Trilinos design, describing our use of abstract interfaces and default concrete implementations. We discuss the services that Trilinos provides to a prospective package and how these services are used by various packages. We also illustrate how packages can be combined to rapidly develop new algorithms. Finally, we discuss how Trilinos facilitates highquality software engineering practices that are increasingly required from simulation software.}},

The algorithm is derived for the unsteady Euler equations that are discretized for second-order accuracy in both space and time and takes into account the effect of dynamic meshes. In addition to error due to temporal resolution, the formulation also takes into account algebraic error arising from partial convergence of the governing equations at each implicit time step. The resulting error distributions are then used to drive adaptation of the temporal resolution and the convergence tolerances for the governing equations at each time step. The method is demonstrated in the context of both time-integrated and instantaneous functionals and the results are compared against traditional adaptation methods.}},

    abstract = {{Solutions to optimization problems with pde constraints inherit special properties; the associated state solves the pde which in the optimization problem takes the role of a equality constraint, and this state together with the associated control solves an optimization problem, i.e. together with multipliers satisfies first and second order necessary optimality conditions. In this note we review the state of the art in designing discrete concepts for optimization problems with pde constraints with emphasis on structure conservation of solutions on the discrete level, and on error analysis for the discrete variables involved. As model problem for the state we consider an elliptic pde which is well understood from the analytical point of view. This allows to focus on structural aspects in discretization. We discuss the approaches First discretize, then optimize and First optimize, then discretize, and consider in detail two variants of the First discretize, then optimize approach, namely variational discretization, a discrete concept which avoids explicit discretization of the controls, and piecewise constant control approximations. We consider general constraints on the control, and also consider pointwise bounds on the state. We outline the basic ideas for providing optimal error analysis and complement our analytical findings with numerical examples which confirm our analytical results ({\copyright} 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

    abstract = {{Summation-by-parts (SBP) operators are finite-difference operators that mimic integration by parts. The SBP operator definition includes a weight matrix that is used formally for discrete integration; however, the accuracy of the weight matrix as a quadrature rule is not explicitly part of the SBP definition. We show that SBP weight matrices are related to trapezoid rules with end corrections whose accuracy matches the corresponding difference operator at internal nodes. For diagonal weight matrices, the accuracy of SBP quadrature extends to curvilinear domains provided the Jacobian is approximated with the same SBP operator used for the quadrature. This quadrature has significant implications for SBP-based discretizations; in particular, the diagonal norm accurately approximates the L2 norm for functions, and multi-dimensional SBP discretizations accurately approximate the divergence theorem.}},

The present work focuses on the application of higher-order, hierarchical basis functions to the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations using a stabilized finite element method. It is shown on a variety of problems that the most cost-effective simulations (in terms of CPU time, memory, and disk storage) can be obtained using higher-order basis functions when compared with the traditional linear basis. In addition, algorithms will be presented for the efficient implementation of these methods within the traditional finite element data structures.

The largest number of developments have been in the areas of local function approximations and use of intermediate variable and response quantities.

We make use of quadratic discretizations that are C 0 -continuous across element boundaries in standard finite elements, and C 1 -continuous in the case of NURBS. The variational multiscale residual-based method (Bazilevs in Isogeometric analysis of turbulence and fluid-structure interaction, PhD thesis, ICES, UT Austin, 2006; Bazilevs et al. in Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng, submitted, 2007; Calo in Residual-based multiscale turbulence modeling: finite volume simulation of bypass transition.

    abstract = {{The present study investigates the effect of taking into account the time dependency of the fine (subgrid) scales in a residual-based variational multiscale approach for large eddy simulation. The residual-based variational multiscale method with time-dependent (dynamic) subgrid scales is presented, and the impact of the time dependency is studied for the well-known test case of turbulent channel flow. Results are presented from computations for various values of the Reynolds number, namely  Re τ =180 ,  Re τ =395  and  Re τ =590 , and several time-step sizes. A generalized-α time-integration scheme is employed. Results from our numerical experiments with dynamic subgrid scales are compared to results obtained with an approximation not explicitly taking the time-dependency of the subgrid scales into account. For all  Re τ  values and time-step sizes under consideration, results for resolved quantities computed by both approaches are very similar. This statement applies to both, mean streamwise velocity and root-mean-square velocity fluctuations. However, it provides a model for the subgrid-scales not depending on the time-step size and enabling a more robust representation of unresolved scales. Thus we conclude that the time-dependent subgrid-scale approximation is not capable of producing more accurate results for this type of flow if the time-step size is chosen within an optimal range. However, we expect it to be more advantageous for more complex problems, since our results indicate that it provides a more reliable representation of unresolved scales.}},

    abstract = {{A mixed model based on the residual-based variational multiscale (RBVM) formulation is proposed for the large eddy simulation of turbulent flows. In this model the cross stresses are modeled by the RBVM term and the Reynolds stresses are represented by a Smagorinsky eddy viscosity. The mixed model is motivated by an a priori analysis of a turbulent flow field that indicates that the RBVM term correctly models the dissipation induced by the cross-stress term but underpredicts the contribution from the Reynolds stress term. The dynamic version of the mixed model is implemented in a Fourier-spectral code in order to predict the decay of incompressible, three-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence. It is found that the mixed model yields better agreement with direct numerical simulation solution than the dynamic Smagorinsky and the RBVM models, which are its building blocks.}},

@article{haber:2001,
    abstract = {{The problem of recovering a parameter function based on measurements of solutions of a system of partial differential equations in several space variables leads to a number of computational challenges. Upon discretization of a regularized formulation a large, sparse constrained optimization problem is obtained. Typically in the literature, the constraints are eliminated and the resulting unconstrained formulation is solved by some variant of Newton's method, usually the Gauss–Newton method. A preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm is applied at each iteration for the resulting reduced Hessian system.    Alternatively, in this paper we apply a preconditioned Krylov method directly to the KKT system arising from a Newton-type method for the constrained formulation (an 'all-at-once' approach). A variant of symmetric QMR is employed, and an effective preconditioner is obtained by solving the reduced Hessian system approximately. Since the reduced Hessian system presents significant expense already in forming a matrix–vector product, the savings in doing so only approximately are substantial. The resulting preconditioner may be viewed as an incomplete block-LU decomposition, and we obtain conditions guaranteeing bounds for the condition number of the preconditioned matrix.    Numerical experiments are performed for the dc-resistivity and the magnetostatic problems in 3D, comparing the two approaches for solving the linear system at each Gauss–Newton iteration. A substantial efficiency gain is demonstrated. The relative efficiency of our proposed method is even higher in the context of inexact Newton-type methods, where the linear system at each iteration is solved less accurately.}},

    abstract = {{We present a nonlinear optimization method for large-scale 3D elastic full-waveform seismic inversion. The method combines outer Gauss–Newton nonlinear iterations with inner conjugate gradient linear iterations, globalized by an Armijo backtracking line search, solved on a sequence of finer grids and higher frequencies to remain in the vicinity of the global optimum, inexactly terminated to prevent oversolving, preconditioned by L-BFGS/Frankel, regularized by a total variation operator to capture sharp interfaces, finely discretized by finite elements in the Lam\'{e} parameter space to provide flexibility and avoid bias, implemented in matrix-free fashion with adjoint-based computation of reduced gradient and reduced Hessian-vector products, checkpointed to avoid full spacetime waveform storage, and partitioned spatially across processors to parallelize the solutions of the forward and adjoint wave equations and the evaluation of gradient-like information. Several numerical examples demonstrate the grid independence of linear and nonlinear iterations, the effectiveness of the preconditioner, the ability to solve inverse problems with up to 17 million inversion parameters on up to 2048 processors, the effectiveness of multiscale continuation in keeping iterates in the basin of attraction of the global minimum, and the ability to fit the observational data while reconstructing the model with reasonable resolution and capturing sharp interfaces.}},

pages="149--171",
abstract="Every Newton step in an interior-point method for optimization requires a solution of a symmetric indefinite system of linear equations. Most of today's codes apply direct solution methods to perform this task. The use of logarithmic barriers in interior point methods causes unavoidable ill-conditioning of linear systems and, hence, iterative methods fail to provide sufficient accuracy unless appropriately preconditioned. Two types of preconditioners which use some form of incomplete Cholesky factorization for indefinite systems are proposed in this paper. Although they involve significantly sparser factorizations than those used in direct approaches they still capture most of the numerical properties of the preconditioned system. The spectral analysis of the preconditioned matrix is performed: for convex optimization problems all the eigenvalues of this matrix are strictly positive. Numerical results are given for a set of public domain large linearly constrained convex quadratic programming problems with sizes reaching tens of thousands of variables. The analysis of these results reveals that the solution times for such problems on a modern PC are measured in minutes when direct methods are used and drop to seconds when iterative methods with appropriate preconditioners are used.",
